# JPEG Export

A plugin for [Krita](https://krita.org).


## What is JPEG Export?
*JPEG Export* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).


Krita already allows to export documents as JPEG, but for whom need to find the the right balance between file size and image quality, Krita export functionality doesn't really help.

Basically, the plugin use Krita JPEG export capabilities, but add an improved interface to let user being able to determinate best export options to apply to image.

### Tested platforms

> Notes:
> - Plugin is not compatible with Krita 4.x.x; you must have at least Krita 5.x.x
> - As currently Krita 5 is still in pre-alpha version, plugin is in alpha version and as long as Krita 5 won't be available as a stable version, plugin will be provided as alpha version

Plugin has been tested with Krita 5.0.0 (appimage) on Linux Debian 10

Currently don't kwow if plugin works on Windows and MacOs, but as plugin don't use specific OS functionalities and/resources, it should be ok.
